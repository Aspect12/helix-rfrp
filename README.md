# Red Faction RP Schema
A roleplaying Schema based on Red Faction 1 for [Helix](https://github.com/nebulouscloud/helix).

You need the following content to play, in order to avoid errors and missing textures: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3015825238

This is a semi-rushed Schema created for a DevJam for the [HL2RP Hub](https://hl2rp.net/). As a result, it is not fully playable from a gameplay loop standpoint. Only attempt to use it if you know what you are doing and can fill in the gaps.

The main things that are missing are maps and models. Due to the obscure nature of the schema, there were little to no appropriate assets available in the workshop, and I did not have enough time to make any from scratch or port them from RF1 on my own. I may revisit this in the future once I have more free time.

In the meantime, feel free to fork this repo and continue from where I left off, if you have the willpower.
